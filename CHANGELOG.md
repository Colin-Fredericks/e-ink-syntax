## 0.2.3 - Darker things

- Keywords got darker, which makes the fact that they're bold stand out better.
- The little faint underline for bracket matching was too hard to see, so I made it 2px solid black instead.
- Having all strings as light gray was giving me issues. They're now mid-gray.

## 0.2.2 - Darker scroll thumb

- The scroll thumb was too faint to see, so now it's dark gray.

## 0.2.1 - Dotted select lines

- Shaded selections flickered, so I replaced them with dotted lines around the border of the selection.

## 0.2.0 - Actually on Atom

- Figured out how to add things with apm. Go me!

## 0.1.0 - First Release

- Initial commit
