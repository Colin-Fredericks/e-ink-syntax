# E-Ink Syntax Theme for Atom

I own an e-ink monitor, and the existing greyscale themes I found are not really optimized for it. My guidelines in creating this theme were:

- Use a white background to reduce ghosting.
- Avoid large swaths of grey as certain shades can flicker.
- Meet [WCAG 2.0 AA Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum), or at least let people meet them when they adjust their own font size.

My goals do **not** include looking good on any monitor that isn't e-ink. If that happens, it will be happy accident.

I program primarily in JavaScript and Python, so adjustments I make to the theme will be to improve display for those languages.
